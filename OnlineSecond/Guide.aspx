    I will take you through this platform and tell you what you can do here.<br />
    Basically we try to connect buyers and sellers of books and specifically this platform is meant for second hand books.
    So, You are here either to buy or sell your second hand book.<br /><br />
    Now, in order to buy a book, you can just browse through our category section and if you see a book that you might like,
    you can click on that specfic book which will take you to the details of the seller where you can contact with that person and schedule 
    a meeting to buy that book.<br />
    But if you are looking to sell your own second hand book, then you must have an account in this portal so that the buyer can reach you
    through phone or email, which ever you provide.<br /><br />
    Thank you for your time, <br />
